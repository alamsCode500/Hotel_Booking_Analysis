# Hotel Booking Analysis
This project is an analysis of a hotel booking dataset, aimed at deriving insights to optimize operations, increase revenue, and reduce cancellations in the hotel industry. The analysis covers various aspects such as customer segmentation, booking trends, cancellation patterns, and more. The goal is to help hotel businesses understand key factors affecting their performance and develop data-driven strategies to improve customer satisfaction, revenue, and operational efficiency.

# Project Overview
In this project, we analyzed a hotel booking dataset containing details such as customer type, booking information, reservation status, and special requests. By exploring various factors such as lead time, market segment, special requests, and cancellation rates, we generated actionable insights that can help improve booking management and hotel revenue.

# Data Overview
The dataset used in this analysis contains the following key columns:

* **hotel:** Type of hotel (e.g., Resort or City hotel)
* **is_canceled:** Whether the booking was canceled (1 = canceled, 0 = not canceled)
* **lead_time:** The number of days between booking and arrival
* **arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, arrival_date_day_of_month:** Date-related information for the booking
* **stays_in_weekend_nights:** Number of weekend nights stayed
* **stays_in_week_nights:** Number of week nights stayed
* **adults, children, babies:** Number of people in the booking
* **meal:****** Meal plan
* **country:** Country of origin of the guest
* **market_segment:** Market segment of the booking (e.g., Corporate, Online Travel Agent)
* **is_repeated_guest:** Whether the guest is a repeated guest (1 = yes, 0 = no)
* **previous_cancellations:** Number of previous cancellations by the guest
* **adr:** Average Daily Rate (ADR) in the booking
* **reservation_status:** Current status of the reservation (e.g., Confirmed, Canceled)
* **total_of_special_requests:** Number of special requests made by the customer
* **customer_type:** Type of customer (e.g., Business, Leisure)
* **days_in_waiting_list:** Number of days the booking was in the waiting list

# Project Steps

# 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
* Loaded the dataset and performed an initial exploration to understand the structure of the data.
* Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and converting columns into appropriate data types.

# 2. Descriptive Analysis and Visualization
* Analyzed the distribution of key variables such as lead_time, adr, special_requests, and cancellation_rate.
* Used visualization tools like histograms, bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
  
# 3. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
Investigated relationships between pairs and groups of variables using various types of plots:
* **Bivariate Analysis:** Analyzed the impact of factors like lead time and customer type on cancellation rates and ADR.
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Studied complex relationships involving multiple factors such as hotel type, lead time, and special requests.
  
# 4. Key Insights
* Identified key factors affecting booking behavior, including booking lead time, cancellation rates, and customer segments.
* Found patterns indicating high cancellation rates with certain customer types and long booking lead times.
* Uncovered opportunities to optimize pricing strategies based on seasonality and customer type.
  
# 5. Recommendations
* Implement dynamic pricing strategies to adjust for demand fluctuations based on booking lead time and market segment.
* Reduce cancellations by targeting long-lead bookings with flexible policies and personalized offers for frequent guests.
* Enhance operational efficiency by adjusting staffing levels according to booking trends during peak and off-peak seasons.
